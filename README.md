# Spark Template

This repository provides a minimal Spark template designed to help you start developing, testing, and scaling Spark applications quickly and efficiently.

## Overview

The Spark Template serves as a clean starting point for new projects. It includes only the essential setup required to run Spark in a local development environment, allowing you to focus on building your application logic without unnecessary overhead.

## What’s Included

- Minimal and clean Spark project structure  
- Pre-configured environment for local development  
- Ready to be extended and scaled according to your needs  

## Getting Started

1. Open the repository in your Codespace or local environment.
2. Review the existing structure to understand the baseline setup.
3. Start adding your Spark jobs, configurations, and dependencies as required.

This template intentionally avoids opinionated patterns to give you full flexibility in defining your architecture.

## Usage Notes

- This repository is intended as a starting point, not a finished solution.
- You are free to modify, extend, or restructure it to fit your project requirements.
- If you are only exploring and do not intend to continue, you can safely delete the repository. No residual resources will remain.
